## Interview

### Interviewer: "If you had to choose a spirit animal, what would it be?"

You: "I choose the octopus. It stands out as an animal that may not be known for its communication in the traditional sense, such as vocalizations or complex social signals found in other animals, but it compensates with remarkable intelligence, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. Octopuses are masters of camouflage, able to change their skin color and texture in moments to blend into their surroundingsâ€”a skill that reflects an advanced form of non-verbal communication with their environment. They possess a unique intelligence that allows them to solve puzzles, escape from enclosures, and use tools, showcasing an exceptional ability to interact with and manipulate their environment to their advantage. This combination of traits makes the octopus a fascinating example of an animal that, while not a communicator in the usual sense, possesses a remarkable set of compensatory skills.

### Interviewer: "How would your boss and friends describe you?"

You: "My boss would probably say that I am the first choice when it comes to solving tricky problems. I excel in the challenge of complex projects and value a mixture of trust and commitment. My friends, on the other hand, would highlight my curiosity and emphasize that I am always willing to learn something new or take on a challenge, be it a brainteaser. Both would agree that I am reliable and determined, always ready to give a hand or have a laugh, and that I combine seriousness with a sense of humor."

### Interviewer: "If you were to write an autobiography, what would it be titled and why?"

You: "I think I would call it 'The Uncharted Path: Navigating My Life'. This title speaks to me because it reflects my own path - I haven't followed a straight or predictable path in life or in my career. The Uncharted Path' represents the less traveled paths I've taken, full of unexpected twists and turns and learning experiences. 'The Uncharted Path: navigating my life' is a play on my passion for willingness to learn, but also a metaphor for how I picture self-fulfillment, navigating the complexities and challenges life throws at me. It's about finding patterns, making decisions and sometimes just trusting my gut. The title expresses my belief that life is not just about numbers or surface details, but about digging deeper, understanding the story behind the person and using that understanding to develop yourself."
