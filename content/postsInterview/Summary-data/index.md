## About Myself

![Interview](/On_the_way.png)

My journey into data science didn't follow the usual path. Instead of going straight from high school to university, I carved my own path through a program that valued my work experience just as much as any academic grade. This was my stepping stone into the world of academia, setting the stage for everything that followed.

At university, I dived into Industrial Engineering, but the real game-changer was what happened outside the classroom. Driven by a blend of curiosity and determination, I spent my free time teaching myself data science. Through online courses, countless articles, and hands-on projects, I faced a fair share of challenges. Yet, each problem solved and each project completed felt like a victory, fueling my passion for the field even more.

When asked about my strengths and weaknesses, I see my relentless drive to push my limits as both. This pursuit of excellence and constant self-improvement has defined my approach to data science, turning every new challenge into an opportunity to grow. Yet, I'm also aware of the pitfalls of perfectionism, often being too hard on myself. But in every weakness, I find a new goal, a new mountain to climb, transforming introspection into a tool for personal and professional growth.

If I had to choose a spirit animal, it'd be the octopus. It's not your usual communicator, but its intelligence, adaptability, and problem-solving prowess are unmatched. Like the octopus, I navigate the complex world of data with a keen sense of awareness and creativity, always ready to adapt and overcome challenges.

How would my boss and friends describe me? As a go-to person for tricky problems and someone who's always eager to learn and face new challenges. Whether it's a complex data puzzle or planning the next big adventure, I'm all in. They'd say I balance my dedication to my work with a genuine curiosity about the world, making me both dependable and fun to be around.

If I were to write an autobiography, I'd call it "The Uncharted Path: Navigating Lifeâ€™s Data." It's a nod to my unconventional journey into data science and how I've applied its principles to navigate life's ups and downs. This title captures my belief that life, much like data, is full of patterns and insights waiting to be discovered.

What draws me to data science is the perfect blend of challenge and the chance to make a real impact. It's about diving deep into data to unearth insights that can change how we live and work. The field's constant evolution keeps me on my toes, always learning and growing.

Looking ahead, I see myself as a mentor, sharing my knowledge and passion with newcomers to the field. I want to specialize further in areas that fascinate me and help others find their path in this exciting world.

In short, my journey has been one of self-discovery, challenge, and constant learning. With each step, I've grown not just as a data scientist but as a person, ready to tackle whatever comes next with a mix of enthusiasm, creativity, and resilience.
