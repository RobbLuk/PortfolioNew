## Interview

![Interview](/Interview.png)

### Interviewer: "Can you tell us a little about yourself?"

You: "Of course, I would love to. My path didn't follow the conventional route. Instead of taking the usual way from high school to university, I found a different track to university. My skills and knowledge from my electrical engineering masters were recognized. This opportunity was my ticket to university, and it formed the basis for everything that followed."

### Interviewer: "Could you tell us more about what led you to this field?"

You: "After studying industrial engineering, I decided to self-study to qualify as a data scientist. It was fascinating and I intensively dealt with the materials. I had always been curious about data and how to use it to solve problems, so I began to delve deeper and deeper into data science. I spent all my days and weekends working through online courses, reading everything I could get my hands on to finally understand the required projects. It took a lot of trying, but when I finally solved a problem or put something together that worked, I was slowly getting closer and closer to my goal.

These projects weren't just exercises for me - they were my way of connecting theory and practical application. I love the challenge of unraveling a complex data set to arrive at insights that can drive decisions or create value. This journey of curiosity, self-awareness and a lot of hard work with data science has really ignited my passion for this field. That's why I'm so excited to have the opportunity to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a team."

### Interviewer: "What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses?"

You: "One of the things I really thrive on is pushing my limitsâ€”finding out just how far my strengths, stamina, and flexibility can take me. Every time I encounter a boundary in my capabilities, it doesn't just become a challenge; it turns into my next project, my next mountain to climb. This drive to test and expand my limits is not just about personal growth; it's a core part of how I approach every other area too.

I am someone who does not strive for this particular perfection, and this can be a double-edged sword. It means I'm often too hard on myself, always digging deep to find what I could do better. Sometimes it feels like an arduous quest at times, always looking inward to spot my flaws.

But here's the twist: Every time I discover a new weakness, it turns into my next challenge. It's like finding a secret passage on a map that leads to personal growth. Each weakness becomes a step I use to climb higher, turning introspection into a kind of superpower. It's tough, sure, but it also means I'm constantly evolving, becoming stronger and more adaptable."
