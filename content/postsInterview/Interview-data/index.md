## Interview

![Interview](/Interview.png)

### Interviewer: "Can you tell us a little about yourself?"

You: "Absolutely, I'd love to. My journey wasn't exactly by the book. Instead of taking the usual high school to university path, I found a different doorway into academia. It all started with a special entry program that recognized the skills and knowledge I gained from working, rather than just the grades I might have had on paper. This opportunity was my ticket into university, and it really set the stage for everything that came next.

### Interviewer: "Could you tell us more about what led you to this field?"

After I got into university, I chose to study Industrial Engineering. It was fascinating, and I dove deep into my studies, but the real game-changer for me was what I did outside the classroom. I was always curious about data and how it could be used to solve problems, so I started teaching myself data science. I spent nights and weekends poring over online courses, reading anything I could get my hands on, and working on small projects. It was a lot of trial and error, but those moments when I finally cracked a problem or built something that worked were incredibly rewarding.

These projects weren't just academic exercises; they were my way of connecting the dots between theory and real-world application. I loved the challenge of taking a complex dataset and untangling it to reveal insights that could drive decisions or create value. This self-driven exploration of data science was what really ignited my passion for the field. It was a journey filled with curiosity, self-discovery, and a lot of hard work, but looking back, every step was worth it. It's why I'm so excited about the possibility of bringing my skills and enthusiasm to your team."

### Interviewer: "What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses?"

You: "Absolutely. One of the things I really thrive on is pushing my limitsâ€”finding out just how far my strengths, stamina, and flexibility can take me. Every time I encounter a boundary in my capabilities, it doesn't just become a challenge; it turns into my next project, my next mountain to climb. This drive to test and expand my limits is not just about personal growth; it's a core part of how I approach data science too.

I'm someone who's always chasing perfection, and this can be a double-edged sword. It means I'm often too hard on myself, always digging deep to find what I could do better. It feels like a spiritual quest at times, always looking inward to spot my flaws.

But here's the twist: every time I discover a new weakness, it turns into my next challenge. It's like finding a secret passage on a map that leads to personal growth. Each weakness becomes a step I use to climb higher, turning introspection into a kind of superpower. It's tough, sure, but it also means I'm constantly evolving, becoming stronger and more adaptable."
