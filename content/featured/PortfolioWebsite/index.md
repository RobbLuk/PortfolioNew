In this self-directed study, my objective was to explore how to generate significant online attention by starting with a basic JavaScript model template to create my own portfolio website. I aimed to analyze and refine this initial version by comparing it with the final product, which you can now see. This process involved iterative enhancements to ensure the website not only showcased my professional and personal achievements but also stood out in the digital landscape.
