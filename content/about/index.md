Servus! My name is Robert Lukas. I'm 36 years old and from Munich, Germany.

I pride myself on being a resourceful and dedicated professional, guided by strong ethical principles and a robust moral compass. My enthusiasm, coupled with effective communication skills, organizational prowess, and a keen eye for detail, define my approach to work.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Engineering and Management, with a specialization in Information Technology, from Munich University of Applied Sciences [Hochschule MÃ¼nchen, DE](https://www.hm.edu/). My academic journey culminated in a thesis titled "Evaluation of potentials with neural networks in the field of eDiscovery," through which I explored the transformative capabilities of neural networks to enhance eDiscovery processes, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges.

I am an active member of the [Data Science Club - Data Camp](https://www.linkedin.com/school/datacampinc/), where I have engaged deeply with the data science community, honing my skills and knowledge. Throughout my involvement, I have earned certificates that attest to my proficiency and dedication to continuous learning in the field of data science.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
