Servus! I'm Robert Lukas, a 36-year-old data science enthusiast from [Munich](https://stadt.muenchen.de/rathaus.html), Germany.

I bring over a decade of experience as a mechanical engineer and more recent adventures in data science and financial analytics.

I have a degree in Engineering and Management with a focus on Information Technology from Munich University of Applied Sciences [Hochschule MÃ¼nchen](https://www.hm.edu/). My bachelor thesis was on "Evaluation of potentials of neural networks in the field of eDiscovery", which further strengthened my interest in data science.

My professional career includes key roles at Deloitte, where I worked on big data in eDiscovery, and Innoscripta AG, where I conducted research and innovation projects. Most recently, I developed machine learning models at DataCamp to improve the user experience on an online cooking platform and increase user satisfaction through data-driven insights.

Outside of my professional life, I am deeply involved in continuous learning and actively participate in data science communities on [Data Science Club - DataCamp](https://dccertified.datacamp.com/) and [LinkedIn - DataCamp](https://www.linkedin.com/school/datacampinc/). I also enjoy sports, practicing yoga and honing my strategic skills at chess.

Join me as we walk the complex and exciting paths of data science together and use technology to drive meaningful innovation and better decisions. Let's explore, learn and grow together in this dynamic field!
