Error message: The response is not a valid JSON response.</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"./publish-error.png\" alt=\"Publish error\"></p>\n<p>And if I popped open the console, I saw these errors:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./console-errors.png\" alt=\"Console errors\"></p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Since the error message had to do with a JSON response, I initially thought it was a Gutenberg or ACF issue. But it turned out this was happening because I was on the https WP admin (i.e. <a href=\"https://project.ups.dock/wp-admin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://project.ups.dock/wp-admin</a>), not the unsecure WP admin (<a href=\"http://project.ups.dock/wp-admin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://project.ups.dock/wp-admin</a>).</p>\n<p>It was a CORS error!! I was trying to modify a non-https domain from a https domain. Switching to a non-https WP admin allowed me to publish posts with no problem.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"WordPress Publishing Error","description":"Trying to create a simple post in WordPress","date":"2019-12-03","slug":"/pensieve/impressum-data","tags":["WordPress"]}}},"pageContext":{}}}
